# 8Track React-Node

8Track React-Node is a test-driven React App with full CRUD functionality. It uses Axios to make asynchronous calls to the 8Track Node API (of the same series) in production on Heroku.com. 8Track Node stores and exposes data related to artists and songs. 8Track React-Node renders the data to the DOM and provides a simple user interface.

A user can create, update or destroy songs associated with artists. Data is seamlessly updated by the React app.

The architecture of this application intends to follow React conventions and honor the "properties flow down; actions flow up" principle of one-way data flow. As such, properties are passed down and state is set in the App.js file.
